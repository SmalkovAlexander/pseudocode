<br/>Come to the place with socks
<br/>If this box is, then open
<br/>Take the nearest sock in the left hand from the drawer
<br/>Do(when "In the left hand sock will not look like the right")
<br/>    If the socks in the shelf & in drower = 0
<br/>        then this is your ninja way(without socks)
<br/>    Take the nearest sock in your right hand
<br/>    If two mismatched socks
<br/>        then find a place called "shelf"
<br/>        put a sock from the right hand into the shelf
<br/>    If the socks in drawer = 0 & in the shelf > 1
<br/>        sock from left hand thrown in trash
<br/>        all socks are transfered to the "box"
<br/>        takes the closest sock into the left hand
